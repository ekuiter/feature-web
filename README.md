## feature-web

For details on this project, have a look at the [master
branch](https://github.com/ekuiter/feature-web).

### Getting started

After cloning the `example` branch, run the following
([Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
required):

```
composer install
npm install
mkdir tmp && chmod 0777 tmp
```

Now point your browser to `index.php` while running a PHP server (like
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)).

Have a look at `index.php` to learn about configuration options. Feel free to
use feature-web as a starting point for your own product line web interface!
